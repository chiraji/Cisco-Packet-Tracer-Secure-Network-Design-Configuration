# üîê Cisco Packet Tracer ‚Äì Secure Network Design & Configuration

## üìå Project Overview
This project demonstrates the design and configuration of a secure, multi-network topology in **Cisco Packet Tracer**.  
It implements **secure routing, time synchronization, remote management, port security, and ACL-based access control**.

## üéØ Objectives & Tasks

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Topology Design 
- Replicated the provided network diagram in Cisco Packet Tracer.
- Labeled all devices and network segments appropriately.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ IP Addressing
- Assigned **first usable IP addresses** to all router interfaces.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Secure OSPFv2 Routing 
- Enabled **OSPFv2** on all routers.
- Verified end-to-end communication by sending PING requests from **Network A‚Äôs PC** to all other devices.
- **Evidence:** Screenshots of successful pings.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ NTP Server Configuration 
- Configured a **secure NTP server**.
- Synchronized all network devices to the same time source.
- **Evidence:** Screenshots of the synchronized time on all devices.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Secure Remote Management 
- Enabled **TACACS+ server authentication** for remote device management.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Port Security 
**Switch 2 & Switch 3**
- Allowed **two dynamically learned MAC addresses** per port.
- Violation action: **Restrict** port access.

**Switch 1**
- Statically assigned **server and admin PC MAC addresses** to ports.
- Violation action: **Shutdown** the port.

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ ACL Restrictions ‚Äì Web Server Access
- Networks **A, B, D, and E** can only access the **web server**.
- Denied all other traffic to/from these networks.

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ ACL Restrictions ‚Äì Isolated Communication 
- Networks **C and F** can communicate **only with each other**.
- Blocked all communication with any other networks.
